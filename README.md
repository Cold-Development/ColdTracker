- ColdTracker is an advanced plugin for Minecraft servers that enhances the management of staff members' time spent on the server. This plugin provides an accurate way to track staff members active hours, saving all their play sessions in a database to evaluate each member's contribution to community activities.
- Supports `SQLite` database.
- This plugin is based on [`ColdDev`](https://github.com/Cold-Development/ColdDev) library.
